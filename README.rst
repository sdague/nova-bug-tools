 Nova Bug Tools
================

These are a set of tools to do things with the Nova bug backlog (and
possibly other backlogs) to try to help keep things manageable. All
tools work on launchpad in a live state, be careful of what you decide
to run.

Many are experimental and include half baked ideas about ways that you
might want to interact with the bugs.
